# ERC404 Token Marketplace

## Overview

The ERC404 Token Marketplace is a decentralized platform for buying, selling, and trading DN404 tokens. DN404 tokens, short for "Divisible NFT-404", are a novel experimental token standard on Ethereum that combines the best traits of ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards, allowing for fractional ownership of NFTs.

This project uses Hardhat for smart contract development and testing, and React for the frontend.

## Features

- **Buy and Sell DN404 Tokens**: Users can list their DN404 tokens for sale or purchase tokens listed by others.
- **Trade DN404 Tokens**: Users can trade their DN404 tokens with others in a secure and decentralized manner.
- **Wallet Integration**: The marketplace integrates with popular Ethereum wallets for seamless transactions.
